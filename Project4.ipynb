    "Hello everyone! Back at it again, using the same League of Legends dataset as before. Given me some grace, it is hard to find a datset that is good enough for some usage. With this being so large and detailed, it is very easy to like it! Anyway, I will be tryinng somethinng new out with this project and will be revisiting my old projects due to my grade, turns out I was a little too silly and my poor TAs could not find where I was talking about things. So anything important will be in **bold**. Okay? Cool. \n",
    "\n",
    "Link for my lovely dataset and **resources** will of course be in the **bottom**, have fun! Oh and for the sake of everyone, I grabbed the same links that I used in my project 2 for reference as I will be talking about the buffs again and I wish to give everyone the fair chance of seeing what I mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now my lovely viewers, I will start doing my **pip installs** and then we can get to it, I need to make sure that I install everything that I need for this grandious project! Also a small sneak peek for those that really enjoy my writing, please be aware that I will be working with others for my final project of the class but I will be sure to keep my antics. Ta-tah~"

    "Alrighty, so let me explain a few things in case it is needed by the TAs or whatnot. **Pip installs, they were done to pull out specific requirements. Notebooks so that I could bring this out as an HTML file. Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and seaborn were are needed for any graphs that I will need to make. Pandas just because, well, I need it for anything related to Pandas which is this entire project.** Now to future proof my insanity because I know that I likely forgot something that I need to utilize or something else, who knows, anyway. I will say now **any tools added later on will be mentioned in the section that they are used**."
